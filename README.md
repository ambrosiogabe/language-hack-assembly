# Language-Hack-Assembly
This is a syntax highlighter created for the language that you end up making in
the Nand2Tetris course. It is a simple assembly langauge, and highlights keyword
like JMP, JGT and it highlights variables and labels as well.

Install the package on your local Atom text editor by searching for language-hack-assembly,
and it will recognize files under .asm, .hack, and .hck

Hope this helps that assembly programming slightly more :)
